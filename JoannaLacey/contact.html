        <p> 
        I ran my own business selling 
        advanced jewelry designs, beginning in 
        2009. I created my designs using 
        techniques learned during a 3-year 
        apprenticeship with a nationly respected 
        master-artisan.I began selling online in 
        2010. <br>
        I ran my own business selling 
        advanced jewelry designs, beginning in 
        2009. I created my designs using 
        techniques learned during a 3-year 
        apprenticeship with a nationly respected 
        master-artisan.I began selling online in 
        2010. 
        I also added stones for jewelers
        to my inventory.I social marketed through
        Facebook,Etsy,WordPress and other 
        networks. I created professional quality
        product photos and marketing material
        through Photoshop. <br>
        I also updated inventory and website 
        content through several CMS websites
        for eCommerce. I opted to close up shop
        during 2013 to focus on my degree in 
        Web Design and Development, so I could
        have time to further explore my 
        newfound appreciation for web design 
        and social media marketing. <br>
        In 2011, around the time I started selling stones,
        I founded a group of international jewelry 
        artisans, named Wire Geeks. It grew to a 
        sizable group of artisans with over 1800
        members in our chat forum on the cms 
        eCommerce website, Etsy. There are also over
        1800 members on my Facebook page for the
        team. <br>
        My responsibilities up to this point for the 
        team have been social marketing, content 
        creation and graphic design. On top of my other
        responsibilities, I have had the unique 
        opportunity to build healthy business 
        relationships and trust with several top-notch 
        artisans/small business owners from both the US
        and International countries. <br>    
        I still continue to market this group today. My 
        plans are to build a social website for them 
        during the next couple of years, this will be my 
        senior project as I earn my degree. 
        I have gained much experience in many areas 
        marketing both my own wares and other artisans 
        through Wire Geeks.
